This add-on loads the html source code into a [codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) instance. To make the source code more readable uses many functions from luoliyan's recent great add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/410936778" rel="nofollow">HTML Editor Tweaks</a>. You should use his add-on: It's the original and since this add-on loads a webpage it's much slower if you have really much in your field. This warning is mostly relevent if you use Anki incremental reading etc. But on my computer with the fields I use I don't notice a difference. This add-on offers syntax highlighting and a built-in search. This add-on doesn't replace the built-in html view but uses it's own shortcut that you can adjust. You can also adjust the [theme](https://codemirror.net/demo/theme.html) it uses.

Use it at your own risk and the warning from <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/410936778" rel="nofollow">HTML Editor Tweaks</a> also apply here.

If you find a bug let me know on [github](https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__editor_edit_html_extended). Also merge requests, improvements and feedback is welcome.
