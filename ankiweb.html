This add-on loads the html source code into a <a href="https://codemirror.net/" rel="nofollow">codemirror</a> instance. To make the source code more readable it uses many functions from luoliyan's recent great add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/410936778" rel="nofollow">HTML Editor Tweaks</a>. You should use his add-on: It's the original and since this add-on loads a webpage it's much slower if you have really much in your field. This warning is mostly relevant if you use Anki incremental reading etc. But on my computer with the fields I use I don't notice a difference. This add-on offers syntax highlighting and a built-in search. This add-on doesn't replace the built-in html view but uses it's own shortcut that you can adjust. You can also adjust the <a href="https://codemirror.net/demo/theme.html" rel="nofollow">theme</a> and key layout it uses. Maybe you should just use a different add-on that loads the field source code directly into your editor of choice ...

Use it at your own risk and the warning from <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/410936778" rel="nofollow">HTML Editor Tweaks</a> also apply here. No support, but if you find a bug let me know on <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__editor_edit_html_extended" rel="nofollow">github</a> - maybe I'll have an idea. Also merge requests, improvements and feedback is welcome.
