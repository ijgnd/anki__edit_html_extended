This add-on is an editor for html or css source code using a <a href="https://codemirror.net/" rel="nofollow">codemirror</a> instance. 

You must read the sections "Limitations" and "Alternatives" below before you use it!

This editor offers syntax highlighting and a built-in search. You can adjust the <a href="https://codemirror.net/demo/theme.html" rel="nofollow">theme</a> and key layout it uses ("sublime","emacs","vim").

This editor is used for two functions: 

1. In the anki editor you can edit the source code of a field. This add-on doesn't replace the built-in html view but uses it's own button and shortcut (that you can adjust in the add-on config):

2. You can edit the Front Template, Styling, or Back Template in the Card Layout window. There's an additional entry in the context menu when you right-click on of those fields.

When you edit in the Card Layout window you can also save a version and then later compare it (or restore with copy and paste). 

The dialog that lists versions (on the left in the following window) has a dropdown menu that lists all saved versions of the form you edit. Under the dropdown menu you have a simple preview of this saved version.
On the top right of this versions window there's a button "open folder" which shows the folder that contains the saved versions in your file explorer.
On the lower left there's a button "Diff with current" that diffs what you have in the extended editor and what you selected in the dropdown menu in an external program. The latter option requires that you adjust the add-on config.

<b># Editing a field</b>
If you click the add-on button while holding the shift-key you revert the field to the state before you opened this html source view.

When you open the window the cursor position is synced by reusing code from glutanimate's <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/138856093" rel="nofollow">Sync Cursor Between Fields and HTML Editor</a>. When you close the window the cursor is not synced.

This add-on changes the html source code unless you close this html source code window with "Esc" or "Cancel". This doesn't bother me because I have problems very rarely and I always see them right after closing the codemirror window so that I can quickly undo with Shift. This add-on with its current system of automatically adjusting the html source code has been available for over 8 months until I got the first complaint (see the negative review from 2020-07-15 below). Maybe my add-on just works for most people or maybe all users silently suffer or maybe no one uses it ...

This add-on will always remove the strings "<&#x200b;!--StartFragment--&#x200b;>" "<&#x200b;!--EndFragment--&#x200b;>". 

Furthermore the js editor I use (codemirror) might modify your source code. I haven't investigated this.

By default my add-on processes the html of a field <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> you close the codemirror window. You can disable this in the add-on config by setting "Format code after closing (minify/compact)" and "Format code before opening (unfold)" to "false". 

By default before the html source code is loaded into codemirror I run I process it with the python function "prettify" from the beautifulsoup4 package. By default after closing the editor I process the code with the python package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/htmlmin/#description" rel="nofollow">htmlmin</a>. Alternatively you can also use functions from luoliyan's add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/410936778" rel="nofollow">HTML Editor Tweaks</a>. If you want to use luoliyan code the warning from <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/410936778" rel="nofollow">HTML Editor Tweaks</a> also applies here. 

In the codemirror window there's a button "Autoformat Code". This is mostly relevant if you have set the config "Format code before opening (unfold)" to "false". This button uses the js library <a href="https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify" rel="nofollow">js-beautify</a>. This js library is popular but apparently it has some problems, see the linked page for details. Btw: Codemirror does not include a similar library even though on the official codemirror site there's a demo <a href="https://codemirror.net/2/demo/formatting.html" rel="nofollow">Formatting demo</a>. It uses code that was removed from the codemirror release due to low quality, see <a href="https://codemirror.narkive.com/VXbzpp6b/autoformatrange-removed-but-replaced-by-what-how-to-format-html" rel="nofollow">here</a>

<b># Limitations</b>
see the section "Editing a field" for details how this add-on will always change the html source code of your fields!!

This add-on does not save the front/css/back per card template. Instead all fronts are saved into one folder for one note type. This is not good if you use many quite similar card templates. If this add-on used a different subfolder for each card template the folder names would have to be adjusted whenever the card templates are reordered (repositioned). I'd have to wrap onReorder. That's on my todo list.

<b># Alternatives</b>
Before you use my add-on have a look at another add-on with a promising title that I haven't tried that's named <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/16727059" rel="nofollow">External Editor</a> which has this description (in 2020-07): "Replaces built-in html editor with the one of your choice. Next time you press Ctrl + x while editing a field it'll try to execute your configured editor. I created this add-on because I had spent lot of time copying from Anki to vim, editing, and copying back."

<b># bugs</b>
No support, if you find a bug let me know on <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__editor_edit_html_extended" rel="nofollow">github</a> - maybe I'll have an idea. Also pull requests, improvements and feedback is welcome.
